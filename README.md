# Multi-Objective Gaussian Process Dynamic Programming

This is the primary implementation of multi-objective gaussian process dynamic programming.  In its current state the code is not completely general and was built primarily for the shiny app. The code is mostly a translation from matlab code, it is still work in progress and not optimized for R. 

## Getting Started

Currently the shiny app works as is.  The code is undergoing changes to be able to work for more general systems.
